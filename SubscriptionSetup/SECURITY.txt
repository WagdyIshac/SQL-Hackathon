Notice that the environment has fixed passwords (except for the admin account created at the beginning) and this password is published in the guides on Github
So make sure the following:
-	Do not use your standard or paid subscription without changing the passwords
-	Shut down the VMs when they are not in use
-	Limit RDP to participant VMs to the ranges needed
-	Disable the participant (SQLHACK_TEAMxxâ€¦) and demouser Azure AD accounts when they are not in use
-	Enable MFA on the admin account
